<p>My story for this assignment is just something that I would do on a typical morning - make coffee, check my blood sugars (the joys of being diabetic), 
head to the store to pick up test supplies and buy stuff for my dogs.  Nothing spectacular.</p>
<p>I had issues with my code.  As I stated in my video review, I broke my code into separate pieces and ran them until I got the results I wanted.  However
I encountered issues when I put them together in my final javascript file.  For some reason, return values that previously were showing up on the console,
were now blank.  Only the last returned value was visible.  I moved the function calls around, so I know the values were there but they would not appear.
As I'm not sure why this is, I am using a bit of a work-around by console logging the returned values.</p>
